# Views abot the task
I found that the tasks were very good as it helped me learn about many new things and also gave me an motivation to look more into the details. I found many of the tasks as very entertainig and fun but also saw many questions which I could not solve which made me a bit sad. But in the end because of this, I now have more experience and knowledge than when I started out.

# About Me
Hi my name is Shiv Sanjay and I am from Thiruvananthapuram. I got to know about the amFOSS club through my teachers. But I have been aware of the FOSS community for 2 years. As I started looking into FOSS and various organisations like the FSF and EFF and the ideas of Richard Stallman I became even more interested and installed GNU/Linux into my computer. My first Distro was Linux Mint but currently I am using Manjaro Linux. And I am very proud to say that I have also installed Arch btw.\
My interest in the FOSS community and the prospect of gaining more knowledge about programming from my seniors is  what makes me want to join the club.
